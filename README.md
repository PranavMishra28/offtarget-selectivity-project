## Testing & Validation

This repository includes a comprehensive, automated test suite and clear guidelines for validating all pipeline components, outputs, and the interactive dashboard UI.

### 1. Run the Comprehensive Test Suite

The main test script is `comprehensive_test.py`. It validates:

- All core pipeline components (NEBULA, SPARROW, Empirical Binding, Structure Modeling, IMPACT, Expression Filter, Dashboard, Conflict Resolution, Toxicophore Detection, AI Explanation)
- Output file generation and data quality
- UI/dashboard rendering and static assets
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration and robustness validation

**To run the full test suite:**

```bash
python comprehensive_test.py
```

**Expected Results:**

- **Success Rate**: 96.4% (81/84 tests passed)
- **Execution Time**: ~7 minutes (408 seconds)
- **Memory Usage**: 163.8 MB
- **Output Size**: 27.5 MB across 33 files

- All outputs will be written to `comprehensive_test_outputs/`.
- A detailed test report is saved as `comprehensive_test_outputs/comprehensive_test_report.json`.

### 2. Output & Data Quality Validation

The test suite automatically checks:

- That all expected output files are generated and non-empty
- That SDF, CSV, and JSON files are valid and parseable
- That key metrics and summary statistics are present

You can also manually inspect outputs in the respective subdirectories (see Output Structure above).

### 3. UI & Dashboard Testing

The dashboard and all interactive visualizations are generated in `final_dashboard/`.

**To test the dashboard UI:**

1. Open `final_dashboard/dashboard_index.html` in your web browser.
2. Check that all links, tabs, and navigation work.
3. Verify that all interactive charts (Plotly, etc.) render and respond to user input.
4. Confirm that static images (e.g., `summary_dashboard.png`, `binding_pose.png`) are present and display correctly.
5. Review the comprehensive HTML report: `final_dashboard/comprehensive_report.html`.

**Automated UI checks:**

- The test suite verifies that all dashboard files are generated and non-empty.
- For advanced UI testing, consider using browser automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) to script user interactions and screenshot comparisons.

### 4. Interpreting Test Results

- **PASS**: Component or file is present, valid, and functional.
- **FAIL**: Component did not run, output is missing/corrupt, or a critical error occurred.
- **WARN**: Output is present but may be empty or incomplete (e.g., due to missing API data).
- **INFO**: Informational messages about optional outputs or performance.

Review the summary at the end of the test run and consult `comprehensive_test_report.json` for detailed diagnostics.

### 5. Debugging & Troubleshooting

- Check the logs in the console and in the test report for error messages and stack traces.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- If API endpoints are unavailable, check your internet connection and API keys/configuration.
- For UI/dashboard issues, try a different browser or clear your cache.
- For SDF/CSV/JSON parsing errors, inspect the files for formatting issues or missing data.

### 6. Best Practices for Production Validation

- Always run the full test suite before deploying or sharing results.
- Manually review dashboard outputs for visual/UX quality.
- Validate that all configuration and API endpoints are correct for your environment.
- Use version control to track changes to code, config, and test outputs.
